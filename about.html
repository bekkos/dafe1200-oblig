      <h1 class="introducing">What is attender?</h1>
      <h2 class="intro-message"><span class="pro">Attender</span> will be used to reduce the absence among students in high school. This will be done through an app. It will use on-site services   to know when the student is present at school at the right time. The student will then have the opportunity within a ten minute window to check in for the class. The teacher will get an overview of who has registered that they are present and who is absent. </h2>

        <h3>Use of data</h3>
        <p class="intro">Based on the attendance data we get from each school, we will be able too se what difficulties students may face in their day to day life. From that data we wil be able to plan out solution for the absent students in class, for each school, so they too can get equal learning with other attending students. Students will also have the oppertunity to talk to the school nurse via the app </p>

        <h4>Inbuilt streak system.</h4>
          <p class="intro">Our app comes with a inbuilt streak system. The student builds up a streak that rises for each day the student attends school/class without absence. The streak will not be lost if you not attend, but then it will take longer for you to fill out the bar. The longer a student keeps the streak going, the faster the progress bar will increase. Students who are absent, but return to school with regular attendance, will receive a comeback bonus. Once the bar is all filled up, you wil get various benefits such as tickets to cinema, free food at school and so on.</p>
